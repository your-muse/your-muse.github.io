  <p>
    My fingers close in on nothing. Open again. Flex. Repeat. The pale pink drapes obstruct the afternoon sun from completely lighting up the room. It's a comfortable agony. A brutal serenity.
  </p>

  <p>
    I fist the comforter, pulling it higher. It does nothing to hide me from the inevitable reality.
  </p>

  <p>
    I breathe in. “I make you sad?” I breathe out.
  </p>

  <p>
    He sighs. Exasperated. Fed up.<br>
    “I'm sadder without you.”
  </p>

  <p>
    A treacherous finger comes to caress my naked arm.
  </p>

  <p>
    My attempts to focus on the squeaky ceiling fan are futile. The pillow under my head absorbs my sniffle.<br>
    “That's not how it's supposed to be.”
  </p>

  <p>
    My hand travels up his chest, halting at the nape of his neck.
  </p>

  <p>
    He wouldn't look at me. Perhaps ashamed. Perhaps something else. I have the urge to sit in that corner of this room where the sun can't reach.
  </p>

  <p>
    “That's how it is, I'm afraid.” The audible resignation twists the knife deeper.
  </p>

  <p>
    I cough once.<br>
    Twice.
  </p>

  <p>
    There is a pool of blood.
  </p>

  <p>
    He runs to get a towel. Probably.<br>
    I would never know.
  </p>
